### Hi there 👋

I'm a newly minted data engineer, currently learning all I can about this fascinating field.

📚 And since learning is the best fun, and you may share some of my passions or have a recommendation 🙏 here is my current list:
  - building world class data pipelines (i'm loving James Densmore's Data Pipelines Pocket Reference)
  - writing elegant and highly performant Python code (hoping that Learn PYTHON the hard way will take me there)
  - SQL for analytics and database management (Mode's free SQL tutorial is probably the best out there)
  - dbt and data modeling
  - increasing reach and impact at work (practice of the moment: asking the right questions and listening without assumptions)
  - cooking tasty & healthy food from scratch quickly
  - biomechanics & human movement (MovNat, Katy Bowman, Tim Shieff)
