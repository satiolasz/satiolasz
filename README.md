### Hi there 👋

I'm a newly minted data engineer, currently learning all I can about this fascinating field.

📚 And since learning is the best fun, and you may share some of my passions or have a recommendation, here is my current list:
  - building world class data pipelines (i'm loving James Densmore's Data Pipelines Pocket Reference)
  - writing elegant and higly performant Python code (hoping that Learn PYTHON the hard way will take me there)
  - SQL for analytics, database management and data modeling (Mode's free SQL tutorial is probably the best out there)
  - increasing reach and impact at work (practicing asking the right questions and listening deeply at the moment)
  - cooking tasty & healthy food from scratch quickly
  - biomechanics & human movement
