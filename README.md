### Hi there, I'm Sati 👋

As a dedicated Data Engineer, I'm spending my days diving deep into the art of building world-class data pipelines. I've got a knack for keeping things efficient and simple, with an eye on crafting data systems that stand the test of time. And thanks to a relentless curiosity and love for learning, I'm always finding new ways to up my game.

🛠️ My playground:
- Data pipelines: Refining my ability to construct data pipelines that set the standard for efficiency, scalability, and reliability.
- Python: My go-to for scripting and data wrangling tasks. I love writing clean and quick code.
- SQL: Whether it's managing databases or optimizing performance, SQL is a big part of my toolkit.
- Data modeling: I enjoy the puzzle of creating data models that perfectly fit a business's unique needs.
- Data security: Protecting sensitive data is always top of mind—I incorporate security measures into every step of my pipelines.
- Beyond work, I am passionate about creating nutritious meals and enjoy deepening my understanding of biomechanics and human movement.

🎯 Current Ventures
I'm presently working on creatin and maintaining data pipelines at Typeform, all while ensuring they run smoothly and effectively.

🧰 Favorite Tools
AWS, MySQL, Postgres, Kafka, Airflow, Redshift, JIRA, Slack - these are just a few of the tools that help me get the job done.
