### Hi there 👋

I'm a newly minted data engineer, currently learning all I can about the data engineering field in general and building world class data pipelines in particular. 

📚 And since it's always useful to learn something new, or get better at something not so new, and learning is the best fun anyways, here is my current list:
  - writing elegant and higly performant Python code
  - SQL for database management and data modeling 
  - increasing reach and impact at work, while still having loads of free time
  - cooking tasty & healthy food from scratch quickly
  - biomechanics & human movement

### ☕️ Let's chat!
